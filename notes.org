* Notes
** Clustering

one way to solve single threaded node loop is using clustering

cluster manager checks the health and manages the instances of the node applications.
can start, stop.. administrate worker instances of our node applications.

the cluster manager require the cluster manager module.
*** Cluster Manager
cluster.fork() executes multiple times the same index.js file but creates a new worker instance

apache benchmark ~ab~
~ab -c 2 -n 4  localhost:3000/~

Note: 
don't over cluster!
try to match the children with the number of cpu threads

*** PM2 Cluster manager
#+begin_src
